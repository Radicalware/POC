The code here is either code that has been finished that is not production ready code or code that is just plain out unfished!


Not Production Ready
    * ill Scrappy - This is a metasploit encoder that shows some of the pitfalls in modern AV but also identifies how AV can detect ill Scrappy and what a hacker may want to do to combat that. This project was dis-continued because it is in Ruby and Ruby is a VERY slow language, just like Python. I have given up on Python and won't be using it much in my career any more. RMutate was the last major Python project I will have ever made!

Code Not Finished
    * RFirewall - This tool is built using Qt and is designed to help you manage your Windows firewall. It will help you keep it clean and identfy security vulnerabilities.
